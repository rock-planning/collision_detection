Installation
------------
The easiest way to build and install this package is to use Rock's build system.
See [this page](https://www.rock-robotics.org/documentation/installation.html)
on how to install Rock.

However, if you feel that it's too heavy for your needs, Rock aims at having
most of its "library" packages (such as this one) to follow best practices. See
[this page](https://www.rock-robotics.org/documentation/packages/outside_of_rock.html)
for installation instructions outside of Rock.
